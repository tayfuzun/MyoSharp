C# Wrapper for the Myo Armband

The goal of this project is to create a high-level object-oriented C# API for devs to easily interact with the Myo.

MyoSharp is compatible with .NET 2.0+

### Getting Started
* [`Environment`](#environment)
* [`Sample usage`](#sample-usage)
* [`Visualization in WinForms`](#visualizations-in-winforms)
* [`Pose Sequences`](#detecting-sequences-of-poses)
* [`Holding Poses`](#detecting-poses-being-held)
* [`Roll, Pitch and Yaw Data`](#getting-roll-pitch-and-yaw-data)
* [`Acquiring EMG Data`](#acquiring-emg-data)
* [`License`](#license)


### Environment
* We suggest that you clone down the MyoSharp repository to a directory relative to your project. This will allow you to safely pull down future changes into this repository.
  * **NOTE**: You aren't required to do it this way. You can copy the MyoSharp project and files into your solution if you want, but in my opinion that would make updates a little bit trickier. It's up to you though.
* You should create your new solution and reference the MyoSharp project called "MyoSharp.csproj". This is the project file for the MyoSharp assembly. The other assemblies are examples, and your final project will **NOT** be required to reference these other projects.
  * **NOTE**: MyoSharp is targeted at the .NET 2.0 framework. If you're building projects targeting later frameworks, you should still have no issue referencing MyoSharp assemblies. If you're targeting prior to .NET 2.0... I can't help you.
* MyoSharp uses [Code Contracts](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264808(v=vs.100).aspx). It was our opinion that providing code contracts would allow for a more clear API for our consumers. Please install code contracts to use this project.

### Sample Usage
Here's a simple example of a console program that shows MyoSharp in action:
``` C#
using System;

using MyoSharp.Communication;
using MyoSharp.Device;
using MyoSharp.ConsoleSample.Internal;
using MyoSharp.Exceptions;

namespace MyoSharp.ConsoleSample
{
    /* <summary>
     This example will show you the basics for setting up and working with 
     a Myo using MyoSharp. Primary communication with the device happens 
     over Bluetooth, but this C# wrapper hooks into the unmanaged Myo SDK to
     listen on their "hub". The unmanaged hub feeds us information about 
     events, so a channel within MyoSharp is responsible for publishing 
     these events for other C# code to consume. A device listener uses a 
     channel to listen for pairing events. When a Myo pairs up, a device 
     listener publishes events for others to listen to. Once we have access 
     to a channel and a Myo handle (from something like a Pair event), we 
     can create our own Myo object. With a Myo object, we can do things like
     cause it to vibrate or monitor for poses changes.

### Visualizations in WinForms
Running the MyoSHarp.EmgVisualization project will pop up a form that allows you to view the EMG data that comes in from the device. It uses a ZedGraph component to do all of the drawing, and has some simple features like toggling sensors and zooming in to regions. It's primitive, but it should give you an idea what the data looks like.

### Detecting Sequences of Poses
With this implementation, you can define your own creative sequences of poses. See the example below.
``` C#
using System;

using MyoSharp.Communication;
using MyoSharp.Device;
using MyoSharp.ConsoleSample.Internal;
using MyoSharp.Poses;
using MyoSharp.Exceptions;

namespace MyoSharp.ConsoleSample
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Myo devices can notify you every time the device detects that the user 
    /// is performing a different pose. However, sometimes it's useful to know
    /// when a user has performed a series of poses. A 
    /// <see cref="PoseSequence"/> can monitor a Myo for a series of poses and
    /// notify you when that sequence has completed.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Not sure how to use this example?

    /// - Hit F5 and you should be good to go!
    /// </remarks>
    internal class PoseSequenceExample
    {
        #region Methods
        private static void Main()
        {
            // create a hub to manage Myos
            using (var channel = Channel.Create(
                ChannelDriver.Create(ChannelBridge.Create(),
                MyoErrorHandlerDriver.Create(MyoErrorHandlerBridge.Create()))))
            using (var hub = Hub.Create(channel))
            {
                // listen for when a Myo connects
                hub.MyoConnected += (sender, e) =>
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Myo {0} has connected!", e.Myo.Handle);

                    // for every Myo that connects, listen for special sequences
                    var sequence = PoseSequence.Create(
                        e.Myo,

                // start listening for Myo data
                channel.StartListening();

                ConsoleHelper.UserInputLoop(hub);
            }
        }

### Detecting Poses Being Held
It's easy to be notified when a pose is being held by the user. You can even define an interval to adjust granularity. See the example below.
``` C#
using System;

using MyoSharp.Communication;
using MyoSharp.Device;
using MyoSharp.ConsoleSample.Internal;
using MyoSharp.Poses;
using MyoSharp.Exceptions;

namespace MyoSharp.ConsoleSample

    /// Myo devices can notify you every time the device detects that the user 
    /// is performing a different pose. However, sometimes it's useful to know
    /// when a user is still holding a pose and not just that they've 
    /// transitioned from one pose to another. The <see cref="HeldPose"/> class
    /// monitors a Myo and notifies you as long as a particular pose is held.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Not sure how to use this example?
    /// - Open Visual Studio
    /// - Go to the solution explorer
    /// - Find the project that this file is contained within
    /// - Right click on the project in the solution explorer, go to "properties"
    /// - Go to the "Application" tab
    /// - Under "Startup object" pick this example from the list
    /// - Hit F5 and you should be good to go!
    /// </remarks>
    internal class HeldPoseExample
    {
        #region Methods
        private static void Main()
        {
            // create a hub to manage Myos
            using (var channel = Channel.Create(
                ChannelDriver.Create(ChannelBridge.Create(),
                MyoErrorHandlerDriver.Create(MyoErrorHandlerBridge.Create()))))
            using (var hub = Hub.Create(channel))
            {
                // listen for when a Myo connects
                hub.MyoConnected += (sender, e) =>
                {
				    Console.WriteLine("Myo {0} has connected!", e.Myo.Handle);

                    // unlock the Myo so that it doesn't keep locking between our poses
                    e.Myo.Unlock(UnlockType.Hold);

                    // setup for the pose we want to watch for
                    var pose = HeldPose.Create(e.Myo, Pose.Fist, Pose.FingersSpread);

                    // set the interval for the event to be fired as long as 
                    // the pose is held by the user
                    pose.Interval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(0.5);

                    pose.Start();
                    pose.Triggered += Pose_Triggered;
                };

                // start listening for Myo data
                channel.StartListening();

                ConsoleHelper.UserInputLoop(hub);
            }
        }
        #endregion

        #region Event Handlers
        private static void Pose_Triggered(object sender, PoseEventArgs e)
        {

        }
        #endregion
    }

### Getting Roll, Pitch and Yaw data
Don't get lost in the orientation Quaternion vectors, use the <strong>OrientationDataEventArgs</strong> object to get the roll, pitch and yaw of the Myo
``` C#
